# Cleaning Electoral Rolls

According to the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 

5. Preparation of roll in parts.—(1) The roll shall be divided into convenient parts which shall be numbered consecutively.
(2) The last part of the roll shall contain the names of every person having a service qualification and of his wife, if any, who are entitled to be included in that roll by virtue of a statement made under rule 7.
(3) The names of any person holding a declared office and of his wife, if any, who are entitled to be included in the roll by virtue of a statement made under rule 7 shall be included in the part of the roll, pertaining to the locality in which they would, according to that statement, have been ordinarily resident.
(4) The number of names included in any part of the roll shall not ordinarily exceed two thousand.


6. Order of names.—(1) the names of electors in each part of the roll shall be arranged according to house number, unless the chief electoral officer, subject to any general or special instructions issued by the Election Commission, determines in respect of any part that the alphabetical order is more convenient or that the names shall be arranged partly in one way and partly in the other.
(2) The names of electors in each part of the roll shall be numbered, so far as practicable, consecutively with a separate series of numbers beginning with the number one.

In practice the Rolls do not follow this format resulting in them accumulating ghosts and duplicates as well as dienfranchising genuine voters. This project is to explore the various ways in which we can accomplish the creation of Rolls as required by the Rules.
